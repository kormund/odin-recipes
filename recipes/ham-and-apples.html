    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cintra's castle feasts are always expected to be the ones that cannot be quickly forgotten. Exquisite meats with heavy focus on roasted pork, platters full of fresh fruits, mugs filled with beer, chalices with expensive wines, freshly baked bread - all accompanied by bard’s music and cheerful chats of invited guests. Gourmet dishes need some sophisticated preparation so they can provide some unusual experience for the feast participants. It’s no other with this roasted ham - honey-mustard marinade takes care of sweet&spicy flavour, baking with beer gives a bitter, smoky touch, while caraway, cloves and nigella seeds complement the experience by providing full-bodied spicy finish.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash ham under running water, dry with paper towel. If ham has skin, cut it slightly on top into checkered pattern.</li>
        <li>Mix marinade ingredients (crush garlic). Coat ham in the spices mix and transfer to a pot, cover and put in the fridge for 12-24h.</li>
        <li>Put out marinated ham from the fridge 30 minutes before frying. Take off the marinade and transfer it to a heatproof dish. Then fry meat on a pan, on each side for 2 minutes, on a very high heat. Put pre-fried ham in the heatproof dish.</li>

        <li>Reduce the temp to 130°C/250°F and bake for about 2h, covered, until soft. Baste it with baking sauces from time to time. Add 1-2 tsp of salt after 1 h of baking.</li>
        <li>Wash apples, cut them through in 2/3 of height, remove cores and cover again with their tops.</li>
        <li>Coat apples in soft butter and transfer to oven on the baking tray, near dish with ham for the last 30 minutes of baking.</li>
        <li>10 minutes before the end of baking, pour out the baking sauces from dish to the pan. Increase the temperature to 180°C/350°F, remove the lid and bake ham for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp of honey to baking sauces on a pan, stir and simmer until thick sauce is obtained.</li>
