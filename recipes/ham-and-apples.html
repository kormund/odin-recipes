    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cintra's castle feasts are always expected to be the ones that cannot be quickly forgotten. Exquisite meats with heavy focus on roasted pork, platters full of fresh fruits, mugs filled with beer, chalices with expensive wines, freshly baked bread - all accompanied by bard’s music and cheerful chats of invited guests. Gourmet dishes need some sophisticated preparation so they can provide some unusual experience for the feast participants. It’s no other with this roasted ham - honey-mustard marinade takes care of sweet&spicy flavour, baking with beer gives a bitter, smoky touch, while caraway, cloves and nigella seeds complement the experience by providing full-bodied spicy finish.

    <p>
        Tender, juicy slices of roasted ham with company sour, baked apples are the beloved treat even for the high nobility. Too bad sometimes the feast ends up as a turbulent event in which all the food suddenly ends on the floor...

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>apples, hard and sour variety - 4 large pieces</li>
        <li>walnuts - a handful</li>
        <li>peanuts - a handful</li>
        <li>dried cranberry - a handful</li>
        <li>dried apricots - a few items</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CARAMEL SAUCE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cream 30% fat - 1 cup</li>
        <li>sugar - 3/4 cup</li>
        <li>butter - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>rum - 1 small glass (about 3 tbsp)</li>
        <li>salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>spices or ground cinnamon - 2 pinches</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sugar to a saucepan with a thick and light bottom. Heat it moderatly and shake a saucepan to evenly melt it. When it's dissolved, reduce the fire to a minimum and control the color of the caramel. When it's intensely amber, add warmed whipping cream - beware, it will hiss like an angry wyvern! Vigorously mix it with a wooden spatula. At the beginning, caramel clumps will form, which will completely dissolve as they warm up. Cook the mixture over a low heat for about 10-15 minutes. Stir from time to time until the sauce is smooth. Then add alcohol (rum, vodka or nut liquor - you can also omit this ingredient), salt and spices. Mix everything and cook for a few minutes - the final consistency should resemble liquid honey and its color should be close to one of the toffee candies. Turn off the heat, add the soft butter and mix. Cool the sauce. When it reaches room temperature, the caramel thickens. In case it becomes too thick, you can add more cream or alcohol.</li>
        <li>The nuts and dried fruits mix presented in the ingredients is just a suggestion - the types and proportions of nuts and fruits can be freely changed. Ready mixtures will also work. Cut nuts and fruits into smaller pieces. Then put them in a bowl, add 2 teaspoons of caramel sauce and mix thoroughly. Set aside and go to the next point.</li>
        <li>Wash the apples and cut off the "hats" with a sharp knife (or possibly with the Witcher's sword) about 3/4 of the height - so that the petiole is held in the flesh. Pull out core with a knife by cutting a small circle and taking it out with all the seeds. Be careful not to break the apple through. It is good to help yourself with a spoon to remove unnecessary content.</li>
        <li>Grease a deep baking mold with butter. Fill the core holes in apples with nuts and raisins and press them with a spoon to thoroughly fill the empty space. Cover the stuffed apples with cut off hats - try to match them exactly to the cutting line. Spread each apple on the surface with soft butter (preferably done it with your fingers).</li>
        <li>Put the form with apples into a preheated oven (170°C/325°F)  and bake for about 30-40 min depending on the size, type and maturity of the fruit. The apples are ready when their skin is slightly wrinkled. In addition, you can check their softness with fork and bake a little longer if necessary.</li>
        <li>Apples are best served immediately after baking. Each of them should be poured with a heavy portion caramel sauce. After consuming, the apple regenerates 50 health points and regenerate the motivation to fight monsters.</li>
    </ol>
