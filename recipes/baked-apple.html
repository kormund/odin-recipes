    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Witcher's cuisine is not only about aromatic meats and filling stews. In the arsenal of sweet snacks from the game, the most common are fruits, fresh or dried, sweet rolls or nuts and caramels. It's nothing special, but every skilled host knows how to make an ideal dessert with these ingredients!
    </p>

    <p>
        Simple sweets in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt can also be a great way to thank a savior - an old woman from White Orchard came out with such an idea in the "A Frying Pan, Spick and Span" quest, who gives Geralt bread, juice and baked apples.
    </p>

    <p>
        To prepare this dessert we traditionally used the elements that appear in Geralt's inventory. We also remembered about the alcohol touch - without it the Witcher's universe would not be complete! Dried fruit and nuts as stuffing, a salted toffee sauce with alcohol and a spicy note move the common baked apple into a new dimension of quality!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>apples, hard and sour variety - 4 large pieces</li>
        <li>walnuts - a handful</li>
        <li>peanuts - a handful</li>
        <li>dried cranberry - a handful</li>
        <li>dried apricots - a few items</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CARAMEL SAUCE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cream 30% fat - 1 cup</li>
        <li>sugar - 3/4 cup</li>
        <li>butter - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>rum - 1 small glass (about 3 tbsp)</li>
        <li>salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>spices or ground cinnamon - 2 pinches</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place muhsrooms in a bowl and cover with lukewarm water, soak them for 20 minutes, then drain. Don't discard the soaking water, but get rid of sand residue that may be left at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and grate them on the smallest / fine grating mesh. Squeeze the potato mass through the gaze to separate the liquid, pour the liquid into a separate bowl, and set aside for 15 minutes. Pour out the liquid carefully (discard it), then add starch residue accumulated on the bottom of the bowl to the grated and drained potatoes mass.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, all-purpose flour, potato starch and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the grated potatoes. Mix. The dough should be quite dense at this point. Put the dough on a large, flat plate, level it with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Boil a few liters of water in a large pot, add 1 tablespoon of salt. Put a few dumplings into boiling water - by pulling the small portion of a dough with a wet spoon from the plate directly into the water.  After 1 minute, gently stir them with wooden spoon. Cook the dumplings for about 4 minutes after they float to the surface. If they break up while cooking in water, add more flour to the mass and try again. Drain the cooked dumplings and place in a bowl.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, slice the onion. Melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the onion slices for 2 minutes. Then add drained mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of soaking water and stir-fry for 10 minutes on low heat, until slightly browned. Season with salt, fresh pepper and bear's garlic. Finally, add the cooked dumplings and fry over medium heat for one minute, stirring gently but frequently. Serve immediately.</li>
