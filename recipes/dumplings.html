    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        What do witchers eat? Probably you asked yourself this question more than once … in turn, we would rather ask if witchers, except skills useful in their profession, also have a culinary talent?

        It might seem that after passing the mutations trial, qualified monster killers are not really familiar with culinary pleasures. Nothing could be more wrong! In books, Geralt often has an occasion to taste local specialties, from both simple and more exquisite cuisine. White wolf, together with his travel companions, enjoyed dishes served in roadside taverns as well as in the most wonderful inns or royal banquets. Well, but do witchers know how to cook something by themselves? In the books of Andrzej Sapkowski the subject of kitchen arts wasn't pushed into the background by other plots. In addition to the diverse characteristics of the dishes assigned to specific regions and places in the universe, the author even attempted to distinguish some characters by determining their culinary skills. And thanks to that we know what witchers ate in Kaer Morhen and that even one of the them, Lambert, was given a very special distinction… a total lack of culinary talent.

        As in the life of every witcher, duties often outweigh the pleasures. However, in this case we mean the management of responsibilities in the kitchen of witchers' settlement. We still believe that few lessons will be enough to help Lambert increase his cooking skills! Let it be the first one :)  The recipe is based on a traditional, Polish dumplings made of grated, raw potatoes (called “grey dumplings”) and few additional ingredients which fit the surrounding, mountain terrain of Kaer Morhen.
